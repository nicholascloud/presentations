# .NET extensions

- Fiddler2 loads .NET 2.0/3.5 assemblies only (there is a .NET 4.0 version of Fiddler in beta)
- users must have the appropriate .NET runtime installed (2.0 or 3.5)
- each custom assembly declares the version of Fiddler it is compatible with
- assemblies should target `AnyCPU` for 64-bit compatability
- set preference `fiddler.debug.extensions.showerrors` to show errors generated by extensions
- set preference `fiddler.debug.extensions.verbose` to write log messages and warnings to the log tab
- globally available extensions installed to: `%Program Files%\Fiddler2\Scripts`
- user extensions installed to: `%USERPROFILE%\My Documents\Fiddler2\Scripts`

## Extension interfaces

### IFiddlerExtension

Basic interface required to load an extension on startup.

- `OnLoad()`: UI is fully available
- `OnBeforeUnload()`: application is shutting down

### IAutoTamper : IFiddlerExtension

Methods called for each HTTP(S) request/response.  Methods are called on background threads, which has implications for UI components.

- `AutoTamperRequestBefore(Session)`: before the user can edit a request with inspectors
- `AutoTamperRequestAfter(Session)`: after the user can edit a request, and before the request is actually sent
- `AutoTamperResponseBefore(Session)`: before the user can edit a response with inspectors (unless streaming)
- `AutoTamperResponseAfter(Session)`: after the user can edit a response (unless streaming)
- `OnBeforeReturningError(Session)`: when fiddler returns a self-generated HTTP error (e.g., DNS lookup failure)

### IAutoTamper2 : IAutoTamper

Allows extensions to optionally "peek" at response headers before anything handles the response.

- `OnPeekAtResponseHeaders(Session)`: when the response headers become available

### IAutoTamper3 : IAutoTamper2

Allows extensions to "peek" at request headers before anything handles the request.

- `OnPeekAtRequestHeaders(Session)`: when the request headers become available

### IHandleExecAction

An extension that can handle commands entered into the QuickExec field.

- OnExecAction(String)


## Extension preferences

Preferences can be set manually in the QuickExec bar:

`prefs set [name] [value]`

They can also be set by invoking the preferences dialog from the QuickExec bar:

`about:config`

The `FiddlerApplication.Prefs` object implements `IFiddlerPreferences` and allows you to manipulate preferences programatically.

- `Get[Bool|String|Int32]Pref(name, default)`
- `Set[Bool|String|Int32]Pref(name, value)`
- `RemovePref(name)`
- `AddWatcher(filter, handler)`
- `RemoveWatcher(watcher)`
- `[name]` (get/set by indexer)

__NOTE__: Extensions must invoke `RemoveWatcher` when disposed in order to get garbage collected.


## Fiddler objects

Fiddler exposes several useful objects that extensions can access.

### FiddlerApplication.UI

- manipulate sessions in the session (select, unselect, remove) list
- change layout options
- toggle capturing
- set status text / show alert
- copy sessions and session information (e.g., headers, URL, etc.)
- persist session(s) to archive
- etc.

### FiddlerApplication.Log

- log a simple string to the Log inspector (`LogString()`)
- log a formatted string to the Log inspector (`LogFormat()`)

### FiddlerApplication.Prefs

- get/set/remove preferences
- attach/remove preference "watchers" that will be triggered when preferences change

### Session

- manipulate request (`oRequest`), including headers, URL, query string, and HTTP method
- manipulate response (`oResponse`) including headers and response code
- manipulate flags (used by extensions and UI components)
- abort
- query client information (IP address, port, etc.)
- query destination information (IP address, port, host)
- determine if the session is using HTTPS
- examine a number of time spans (`Timers`) that measure the duration of certain parts of the request
- etc.


## Other types of extensions

- importer/exporter extensions
- inspectors (UI)
