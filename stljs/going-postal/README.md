# Going postal: messaging with postal.js #

In this presentation I will cover postal.js, an in-memory service bus for server- and client-side JavaScript development. I will discuss the differences between a service bus and the traditional node eventing model while demonstrating feature differences between postal.js and EventEmitter.  I will then move to the browser and show how postal.js can augment client development, specifically how it works charmingly with jQuery.
