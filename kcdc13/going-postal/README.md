# Going Postal with postal.js

### Presented at KCDC 2013

In this presentation I will cover postal.js, an in-memory service bus for server- and client-side JavaScript development. I will discuss the differences between a service bus and traditional DOM events. I will then move to the browser and show how postal.js can augment client development, specifically how it works charmingly with jQuery.
