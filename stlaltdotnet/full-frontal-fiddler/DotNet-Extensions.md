- Fiddler2 loads .NET 2.0/3.5 assemblies only (there is a .NET 4.0 version of Fiddler in beta)
- users must have the appropriate .NET runtime installed (2.0 or 3.5)
- each custom assembly declares the version of Fiddler it is compatible with
- assemblies should target `AnyCPU` for 64-bit compatability

- set preference `fiddler.debug.extensions.verbose` to write log messages and warnings to the log tab
- globally available extensions installed to: `%Program Files%\Fiddler2\Scripts`
