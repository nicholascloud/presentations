Basic Functional Programming
  Recursion
  Absence of Mutation
  Combinators
  Compositional programs
Advantages
  Reasoning
  Efficiency
  Reliability
  Scaling
  Manageability
  AKA Better Abstractions
Disadvantages
  It's not the one true way
  Object-oriented problems
  Imperative is sometimes the way to go
  Still not as declarative as you might want
Alternatives
  Logic Programming
  Multi-paradigm languages
  Macros
A combined example
  Recursion
  Controlled and isolated mutation
  Compositionality
  Continuations 
  Web programming
